# STM32F407 Discovery Kit Familiarization

The seven projects in this repository intend to give an overview of some core features of the STM32F407 Discovery Kit, as well as provide familiarization and tips for using STM32CubeIDE. While it is recommended to know some C programming, the projects assume no prior microcontroller experience. Detailed instructions for each project can be found in the PDF `STM32F407 Discovery Kit Familiarization`.

It is recommended to complete the projects in the following order:

1. `blink_LED`
2. `user_button`
3. `adc_poll`
4. `adc_interrupt`
5. `adc_dac_dma`
6. `accel`
7. `mic_headphone`

The completed code for each project can be found in the corresponding folder (each containing a complete STM32 project).

After trying these projects, check out [STM32F407 with TFT LCD and MQTT](https://github.com/zvdv/STM32F407-TFT-LCD-MQTT) for examples of how you might design a standalone product with the STM32F407.
